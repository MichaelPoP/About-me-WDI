    <article>   
    <p>Last year I graduated from the University of Arizona with a B.A. in Philosophy, Political Science, Economics, and Law with the prospect of changing the entire world. After months of applying for positions in the Phoenix area I realized the utilization of my abilities required closer interaction with technology. Still looking for opportunities, I was given an offer to stay with my uncle in ‘silicon valley’. I quickly met wonderful and brilliant people involved in everything from web marketing to alternative transportation. I was almost instantly infatuated with the energy and innovation of the area, yet still unsure how I could take advantage of the opportunity. It became clear my academic background enabled me to see human phenomena with an enlightened perspective but I still required the right tools needed to communicate today. I became interested in the engineering behind big data systems, which are important for the creation of political and economic models. After taking a short course on data science I began to consider more ways to develop my computer skills and which skills were most important. A friend suggested the General Assembly Web Development Immersive is the best way for me to get involved in the tech world right away.
